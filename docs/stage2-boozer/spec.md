# Stage 2: Boozer Transform

## Overview

Transforms a VMEC-style equilibrium into Boozer coordinates. Boozer coordinates are the standard system for neoclassical analysis because the magnetic field takes a particularly simple covariant form: the covariant components $I(\psi)$ and $G(\psi)$ are flux-surface functions, not angle-dependent. This stage is a coordinate-transformation step, not a physics solver.

**Position in pipeline:** Receives `wout_*.nc` from Stage 1 (Equilibrium). Outputs `boozmn_*.nc` consumed by Stage 3 (Neoclassical) and indirectly by Stage 4/5.

     Include:
     - Python version and JAX version requirements for booz_xform_jax
     - Fortran compiler and build instructions for BOOZ_XFORM

## Input Specification

| Field | Type | Description | Source |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| `wout_*.nc` | NetCDF file | Full VMEC equilibrium output | Stage 1 |

The JAX version (booz_xform_jax) does not use a separate `in_booz.*` control file. Resolution (mboz, nboz) and surface selection are specified via the Python API. The legacy BOOZ_XFORM uses an `in_booz.*` control file.

booz_xform_jax also accepts in-memory wout-like objects directly from Stage 1, bypassing file I/O.

### Input Validation

<!-- OWNER COMPLETES: Document the input validation checks that should be performed
     before running the Boozer transform. Include:
     - Required fields in wout_*.nc and how to verify they exist and are non-degenerate
     - Sanity checks on mboz/nboz (e.g., must be >= VMEC mpol/ntor, reasonable upper bounds)
     - Surface index validation (must be within the VMEC radial grid range, must exclude axis)
     - Any constraints on the equilibrium quality (e.g., force residual threshold from Stage 1)
     - Error messages or exit codes for each validation failure -->

### Subset Handed to Next Stage

NEO and NEO_JAX need the Boozer spectrum and radial profiles. SFINCS/sfincs_jax use the same Boozer geometry. MONKES and NEOPAX use the Boozer spectrum through direct field or file readers.

### Outputs Used as Objectives

Non-target Boozer harmonics in `bmnc_b` or symmetry-breaking measures built from them. These are **geometry diagnostics**, not transport state variables. Typical objectives include:

- Quasi-symmetry residual: sum of unwanted harmonics relative to the dominant mode.
- Mirror ratio and helical content derived from the Boozer spectrum.

### Output Validation

<!-- OWNER COMPLETES: Document the output validation checks that should be performed
     after the Boozer transform completes. Include:
     - Verify boozmn_*.nc contains all required fields listed above with correct shapes
     - Check that bmnc_b is finite and non-NaN on all computed surfaces
     - Verify iota_b matches iota from the input wout_*.nc to within a tolerance
     - Check spectral convergence: the tail of the Boozer spectrum should decay, not plateau
     - Verify bvco_b and buco_b are smooth functions of the radial coordinate
     - Cross-check: |B| reconstructed from Boozer harmonics should match |B| from VMEC on each surface
     - Define pass/fail thresholds for each check
     - Describe how validation results are logged (stdout, W&B, JSON summary) -->

## Governing Equations

Boozer coordinates satisfy the following dual representation of the magnetic field.

**Contravariant form:**

$$\mathbf{B} = \nabla\psi \times \nabla\theta_B + \iota(\psi)\,\nabla\zeta_B \times \nabla\psi$$

**Covariant form:**

$$\mathbf{B} = \beta\,\nabla\psi + I(\psi)\,\nabla\theta_B + G(\psi)\,\nabla\zeta_B$$

The key property of Boozer coordinates is that $I$ and $G$ are flux-surface functions (depend only on $\psi$, not on the angles). This simplifies the magnetic field strength to a pure Fourier series in $(\theta_B, \zeta_B)$ on each surface.

The Boozer angles are defined relative to the VMEC angles by:

$$\zeta_B = \zeta_0 + \nu$$

$$\theta_B = \theta_0 + \lambda + \iota\,\nu$$

The angle-shift field $\nu$ is determined from the covariant field components. The implementation uses:

$$\nu = \frac{w - I\,\lambda}{G + \iota\, I}$$

where $w$ is reconstructed from the original covariant field harmonics.
