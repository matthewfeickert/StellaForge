# Stage 3: Neoclassical Transport

## Overview

Stage 3 computes neoclassical transport properties from the Boozer-coordinate equilibrium. It contains three sub-stages that can run in parallel, each serving a distinct role:

1. **NEO / NEO_JAX** -- Computes effective ripple (epsilon_eff), a screening/optimization diagnostic. **NOT a transport state variable** -- does not feed into profile evolution.
2. **SFINCS / sfincs_jax** -- Solves the full drift-kinetic equation for neoclassical particle flux, heat flux, bootstrap current, and ambipolar E_r. Direct transport input for Trinity3D.
3. **MONKES** -- Builds a monoenergetic D_ij transport coefficient database. Direct input for NEOPAX (Stage 5).

**Critical distinction:** NEO's epsilon_eff is a screening metric used for ranking configurations. SFINCS fluxes and MONKES D_ij coefficients are actual transport inputs consumed by Stage 5.

**Position in pipeline:** NEO_JAX and MONKES receive `boozmn_*.nc` from Stage 2 (Boozer). sfincs_jax receives `wout_*.nc` directly from Stage 1 (Equilibrium). The three sub-stages fan in to Stage 5 (Transport). Stage 3 runs in parallel with Stage 4 (Turbulence).

### Governing Equations

Field-line integrals:

$$y_2 = \int d\phi\, B^{-2}, \quad y_3 = \int d\phi\, |\nabla\psi| B^{-2}, \quad y_4 = \int d\phi\, K_G B^{-3}$$

Trapped-particle integrals:

$$I_f = \int d\phi\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{B}{B_0 \eta}}\, B^{-2}$$

$$H_f = \int d\phi\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{B}{B_0 \eta}} \left(\frac{4}{B/B_0} - \frac{1}{\eta}\right) \frac{K_G}{\sqrt{\eta}} B^{-2}$$

Class-resolved effective ripple:

$$\epsilon_{\text{eff}}^{3/2}(m) = C_\epsilon \frac{y_2}{y_3^2} \text{BigInt}(m), \quad C_\epsilon = \frac{\pi R_0^2 \Delta\eta}{8\sqrt{2}}$$

Total `epstot` is the sum over classes.

$$+ (\mathbf{v}_{ms}\cdot\nabla r)\left[\frac{1}{n_s}\frac{dn_s}{dr} + \frac{Z_s e}{T_s}\frac{d\Phi_0}{dr} + (x_s^2 - \frac{3}{2})\frac{1}{T_s}\frac{dT_s}{dr}\right]f_{sM} = C_s[f_{s1}] + S_s$$

Collision operator: $C_s[f_s] = \sum_b C_{sb}^l[f_s, f_b]$ with Lorentz, energy-diffusion, and field-particle components.
